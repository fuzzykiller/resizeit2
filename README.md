# resizeit2

A rewrite (from scratch) of the [ResizeIT Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/resizeit/). It hasn’t been updated in years and is not compatible with Firefox 57+.

I think it’s a great tool, especially with frequently changing monitor setups.

This version is not ready yet because I didn’t have time to continue my work.
